Project 1 for BLG439E Computer Project I Course

Project-1 Due:15-11-2020 11:59pm
In this project, students will implement a bitcoin interface (this can be called a bitcoin wallet as well). Bitcoin has its own blockchain network. To create a blockchain network a client should be implemented. Bitcoin has an open-source client that should be
reachable through https://bitcoincore.org/.
Students will build a system based on this client to operate on the bitcoin network. System will have an interface for users to create keys and make transactions on the bitcoin network. Interface should track and display recent proposed blocks in the network and should be able to check their validity. User accounts will be held in a simple database. Detailed information on cryptocurrencies and blockchain can be obtained here: http://bitcoinbook.cs.princeton.edu/. Students should write a detailed report which includes the software modules, interfaces and example operations.
This project is a great opportunity to use your creativity. You may use any
programming language you like. Your code should be understandable with clear formatting and detailed comments.
